# :lock: Security Policy

We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security since, there can still be vulnerabilities present.
If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our systems.

Please follow the principle of responsible disclosure and dont just throw the existence of a security problem out there (in an issue for example) and rather give us a chance to react appropriately.

## :mega: Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do the following and wait at least a day for us to get back to you: 

1. Write an email to the DevOps team of the student council: root@mathphys.info
2. Write an email to the broader student council: fachschaft@mathphys.info
3. Create an Issue with a vague description

If we didnt reach out to you by now all hope is lost (aka there is no one willing/able to fix the issue anyways), just pray :pray:
